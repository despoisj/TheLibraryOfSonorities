		*4 65 sound in minor normal, suspensions are just natural minor scale, but still sus
		Donc rien de spécial, just the 4m65

Weird listz Dim chord Consolation:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfDmUk7ie6s
	Over Db bass: G Bb Db F = Gø7 / Db = #ivø7 / ^1 = #ivø7 / #ivø43 ??, is it like #ivDim / 1 # with missing note?
	In C would be: F# A C E / C -> ??
	Sounds predominant. Is it just Half Dim of V? Like Monte but Hdim? -> ~V -> I
	-> So can be explained by sonority: I -> viiø7/V -> VCh -> I ALL over *1 PP


Triumphant wedge:
	Seems to be I -> III

<!-- <p>This is very similar, and similarly gorgeous. The progression is the "royal road": IV -> V -> iii -> vi, which is very close to the Monte Principale, especially considering the proximity of ii and IV, and the fondness of composers for the *4 *5 bass motion.</p> -->

<p>At 8:29, Bass follows: x A] -> [F# -> B] -> [G# -> D#] -> ~[Bb -> Eb]</p>
<p>Harmony is: Amin -> B64 -> Bmin -> C#64 -> C# -> Eb64 -> Eb</p>

		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSD5lYcyxhY 2nd row

		F#Dim -> F Ab Bb Eb
			-> Voicing in descending 10th 
			TODO similar enough ?

		D# F(D#) B ->Eb C# G
			-> 2nd chord Tenth (essentially a A7 in 43 inv)
			-> Prog is I -> II7
			-> Sound can be I -> V43 with chromatic third approach tone on 13 -> #1 3 -> 2 4
			-> Without it it's just RO

		Tarrega Paquito:
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX66d8vcjag
			Same as albeniz 12 #13 24 with full on Dim on #1 voiced in tenth !! For RO 1 2

	-> Makes it arriving on tenth with some chromatic VL ?

- Fauré Quintet

<?php tt("WIP: Fauré - Piano Quintet n°2 in C minor") ?>
<p>Note: in this passage, the same voicing (C Eb Ab D) appears twice, transposed a third up the second time, but doesn't seem to have the same sound / function as it is not the N6 chord, but just a chord of the 6th. It needs to be investigated further. It's a gorgeous sound, though.</p>
