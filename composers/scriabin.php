<p>Heavily influenced by Chopin before finding his own characteristic voice, Scriabin is known for his lenghty phrases - often starting off-beat, intricated melodies and harmonies using extended chords. Scriabin also seemed to love uneven note groupings (triplets, septuplets, etc.) including against different LH groupings to create complex polyrythms.<p>
<p>Note: the material on this website only covers Scriabin's 'First Period' up to ~1905.</p>
