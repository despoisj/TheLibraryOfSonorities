<p>The V9 Chord creates a lovely sound in Major, with the 9th (^6) <b>resolving up</b> to ^1. Note that traditional voice leading expects the 9th to resolve down instead of up, so this version of the V9 chord is often analyzed as a V7 chord with an appogiatura (^6 -> ^7). This changes nothing for us, as we focus on the sonority.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>


<?php tt("John Field - Nocturne n°5")?>
<p>Last measure: C7 + D -> E -> F.</p>
<?php yt("U-fS3mR9KDA", 1111) ?>

<?php tt("Sigismond Thalberg - Grande Fantaisie, Op. 12")?>
<p>mm. 4: A7 + B -> C# -> D.</p>
<?php yt("dFg02WEwlCM", 33) ?>

<?php tt("John Field - Nocturne n°1")?>
<p>The first turn goes up to the 7th of the dominant chord, the 2nd turn goes up to the 9th (C) which resolves up C -> D -> Eb (but an octave lower).</p>
<p>Note: this piece is great to train your ear as it displays dominant chords with accented 7th in melody, 9th, and 13th (<a href="index.php?filter=element&element=chopin_chord">'Chopin Chord'</a>).</p>
<?php yt("U-fS3mR9KDA", 29) ?>

<?php tt("Arnoldo Sartorio - Romanze, Op. 31")?>
<p>mm. 5: I64 -> V9 (E7 + F#).</p>
<?php yt("62vYPGOe9EM", 76) ?>

<?php tt("Franz Burgmüller - Am Weihnachtsbaum, Op. 100* n°1")?>
<p>Note: This is listed as Op. 100 n°1, but there are two Op. 100, this is not the etudes but the "2 pieces", for which this is the only recording available.</p>
<p>3rd row: G9 (G7 + A).</p>

<h3 class="elementExampleTitle">(WIP) VMaj9 -> V7</h3>

<p>The two examples below share a dissonance which, although subtle, is worthy of investigation. In both cases, the chord starts as a VMaj9 chord that morphs into a V7 chord by contrary motion of the ♮7 -> b7 and the landmark 9 -> 3 sound. To me, it's very close to the V9 sound, especially since it's played on the V chord, where we expect a dominant sound, so I think we can consider it a variation of the V9 sonority.</p>

<?php tt("Alexander Griboyedov - Waltz in E minor")?>
<p>In the 3rd measure of the 2nd line: GMaj9 -> G7</p>
<?php yt("Wv2kNjy2AZE", 34) ?>

<?php tt("Mykola Lysenko - Aveu, Op. 37 n°1")?>
<p>mm. 1: EbMaj9 -> Eb7 -> ... -> Ab</p>
<?php yt("GFRWQwaT2AQ", 80) ?>


<h3 class="elementExampleTitle">V with added 9th & 11th: V(9, 11)</h3>
<p>This chord is equivalent of playing iim7 (or simply IV triad) on top of *5 bass, especially since for this voicing you can't include the third of the dominant chord: for a G11 chord, the third B would clash with the 11th C, this is the 4-3 suspension mentioned in the <a target="_blank" href="index.php?filter=element&element=chopin_chord">'Chopin Chord'</a>. In this example the 9th and 11th <b>resolve upwards</b> by step to 3rd and 5th then again to reach ^1 and ^3.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>

<?php tt("Moritz Moszkowski - Piano Concerto in E Major - Andante")?>
<p>At 16:38, the bar before last.</p>
<p>At 17:32, 2nd row, first staff, 2nd bar in E major: B (*5) in bass, and after I64 (B G# E) we get a dim chord that transforms into F#min7 over B i.e. B7(9,11) i.e. iim7/*5 with the 9th and 11th resolving up: C# -> D#, E -> F#.</p>
