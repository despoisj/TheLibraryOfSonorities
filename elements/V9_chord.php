<h3 class="elementExampleTitle">V9 in Major</h3>

<p>The V9 Chord creates a lovely sound in Major, with the 9th (^6) <b>resolving up</b> to ^1</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>
<p>In the 3rd measure of the 2nd line.</p>
<p>Note: the V9 chord isn't exact as there's a F# instead of a F natural, but it seems in the recordings that many people play it as F natural, hence V9.</p>

<h3 class="elementExampleTitle">V with added 9th & 11th: V(9, 11)</h3>

<p>This chord is equivalent of playing iim7 (or simply IV triad) on top of *5 bass, especially since for this voicing you can't include the third of the dominant chord: for a G11 chord, the third B would clash with the 11th C, this is the 4-3 suspension mentioned in the <a target="_blank" href="index.php?filter=element&element=chopin_chord">'Chopin Chord'</a>. In this example the 9th and 11th <b>resolve upwards</b> by step to 3rd and 5th then again to reach ^1 and ^3.</p>

<p>The bar before last</p>

<p>2nd row, first staff, 2nd bar in E major: B (*5) in bass, and after I64 (B G# E) we get a dim chord that transforms into F#min7 over B i.e. iim7/*5 with the 9th and 11th resolving up: C# -> D#, E -> F#.</p>
