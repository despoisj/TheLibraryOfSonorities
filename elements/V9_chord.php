<h3 id="v9" class="elementExampleTitle">Upward V9 Chord</h3>

<p>What I call the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.academia.edu/114522210/The_Dream_Cadence_A_Study_of_the_Ascending_Ninth_in_Romantic_Music">Dream Cadence</a>, or upward V9 Chord, is a lovely sound in Major created with the 9th of a dominant chord (^6) <b>resolving up</b> to ^1. Traditional voice leading for a nV9 chord expects the 9th to resolve down instead of up, so this chord is sometimes analyzed as a V7 chord with an appogiatura (^6 -> ^7).</p>

<?php tt("John Field - Nocturne n°1")?>
<p>The first turn goes up to the 7th of the dominant chord, the 2nd turn goes up to the 9th (C) which resolves up C -> D -> Eb (but an octave lower).</p>
<p>Note: this piece is great to train your ear as it displays dominant chords with accented 7ths in melody, 9ths (V9), and 13ths (VChM).</p>

<p>At 1:34 2nd row, mm. 2: D7 + E -> F# -> G.</p>
<p>At 2:20 the piece ends with a clear V9 resulting from the melodic line on the dominant.</p>
<p>Note: in this piece, the ninth is approached by the b9th to create a chromatic melody b^6 -> ^6 -> ^7 -> ^1. This V7b9 -> V9 move is an interesting alternative to the expected b9 -> 8 resolution. It can also be seen as nothing more than a a chromatic approach tone to the 9th.</p>

<?php tt("Scriabin - Prelude, Op. 15 n°3 & n°4")?>
<p>n°3: V9 At 3:17 - End of last measure: V9 (B7 + C#) -> I</p>
<p>Note: there is also an E in the chord, which would make it a V9sus chord, not a V11 (see below) because it resolves down.</p>
<p>n°4: V9 At 4:27 - mm. 5: B7 + C# with C# -> D# but the resolution to E is frustrated and only occurs in the bass.</p>
<?php yt("HSESmLtgk0E", 197) ?>


<h3 id="v11" class="elementExampleTitle">V7 with added 9th & 11th</h3>
<p>We can enhance the upward 9th by playing it in thirds with the 11th, resulting in a V11 chord. In this example the 9th and 11th <b>resolve upwards</b> by step to the 3rd and 5th then again to reach ^1 and ^3. The melody follows ^6 ^1 -> ^7 ^2 -> ^1 ^3.</p>
<p><b>Keyboard tip:</b> you can get this chord by playing iim7 on top of *5 bass, especially since for this voicing you can't include the third of the dominant chord: for a G11 chord, the third B would clash with the 11th C. </p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>

<?php tt("Moritz Moszkowski - Piano Concerto in E Major - Andante")?>
<p>V11 At 16:38, the bar before last.</p>
<p>V11 At 17:32, 2nd row, first staff, 2nd bar in E major: B (*5) in bass, and after I64 (B G# E) we get a dim chord that transforms into F#min7 over B i.e. B7(9,11) i.e. iim7/*5 with the 9th and 11th resolving up: C# -> D#, E -> F#.</p>
<?php yt("eh3l8I-JT4Q", 998) ?>


<?php tt("Chopin - Nocturne Op. 62 n°1")?>
<p>mm. 1: F#7 + G# -> A# -> B.</p>
<p>Notet that the melody is the rising 9th but the harmony also feature the rising #11th a sixth below: </p>
<?php yt("kHXxWfSAxik", 5250) ?>



<h3 id="vmaj9" class="elementExampleTitle">(W.I.P.) VMaj9 -> V7</h3>

<p>The two examples below share a dissonance which, although subtle, is worthy of investigation. In both cases, the chord starts as a VMaj9 chord that morphs into a V7 chord by contrary motion of #^4 -> ^4 -> ^3 and the landmark ^6 -> ^7 -> ^1 of the V9. To me, this makes it very close to the V9 sound, especially since it's played on the V chord, where we expect a dominant sound, so I think we can consider it a variation of the V9 sonority.</p>

<?php tt("Alexander Griboyedov - Waltz in E minor")?>
<p>In the 3rd measure of the 2nd line: GMaj9 -> G7 -> I</p>
<p>Note: here the first chord also has a C, which would make it a GMaj11, with the 11th going up ^1 -> ^2 like the V11.</p>
