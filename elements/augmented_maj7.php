<p>The Maj7#5 (or #5/7 or #5/7/9) chord is a particularly dramatic chord that produces a striking effect. Sometimes called <i>"chord of the augmented fifth"</i>, or <i>"mediant ninth chord"</i>, it can be obtained and conceptualized in many ways, the easiest being (in my opinion) as a minor RO suspension of the dominant chord on *4 or *2 moving to *3, or as a modified 7-6 chain.</p>
<p>Because this chord is often used in very chromatic contexts, the roman numeral below will sometimes be given loosely (e.g. ~I -> ~vi6) to understand the local move.</p>
<p>While also found in Romantic music and often used by Bach, this sonority was very present in compositions by French baroque composers such as Couperin or Rameau.</p>
<p>Note: many examples below have been found by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@en-blanc-et-noir">Michael Koch</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://musescore.com/user/30712651">Сергей Щетников</a>, <a taget="_blank" href="https://bernardgreenberg.com/Scores/5954032">Bernard Greenberg</a>, and in the <a target="_blank" href="https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb37059818t">PhD dissertation by Charles Jay Moomaw</a>.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Resolution</h4>

<p>The peculiar Maj7#5 chord and its inversion might seem daunting, but resolves in the same way most of the time. The resolutions have been compiled by <a taget="_blank" href="https://bernardgreenberg.com/Scores/5954032">Bernard Greenberg</a> in the following figure which I have modified a bit. Note that Greenberg has identified other resolutions, which you can find at the end of this article.</p>

<br><br>
<p>One important aspect to notice, as mentioned by Michael Koch, is that since the Maj7#5 chord can resolve down a third to a minor chord or directly to a minor chord of the sixth, it is very appropriate as a predominant in major: IVMaj7#5 -> ii(6) -> V -> I.</p>
<p><b>Keyboard Tip:</b> In root position, the Maj9#5 chord can be seen as a V(7)/b*3, which makes it easy to resolve as the V(7) resolves to i while the bass either stays or drops down to *1. For example, in C major: IVMaj9#5 = F + A7 -> F + Dm (aka ii6) or D + Dm (aka ii). For the inversions, it's more tricky and you'll have too keep track of the suspensions 'by hand'.</p>
<p>WIP: There is a link with °7 chords as well (CF: Rachmaninoff & Liszt), either on *2 -> b*3 or *4 -> b*3 motions like with the suspended V7, but also to lead to the inversions of Maj9#5. I haven't found an easy way to get to those yet.</p>

<h4 id="inv" class="elementExampleTitle">Other uses & inversions</h4>

<p>When inverted, the Maj7#5 chord - also written +Maj7 chord - becomes a +65 or +642. As this chord often naturally occurs on the *3 degree of the harmonic minor scale, it is often found as III+.</p>

<h5 class="elementExampleTitle">First inversion: +65</h5>

<p>In first inversion our IIIMaj7#5 Chord (let's say in A minor) changes from C E G# B D -> E G# B D C = E#7 + b^3. In a surprising twist of events, we realize that this inversion is none other than the minor version of the Chopin Chord: VChm! As a matter of fact, in minor, the Chopin chord is sometimes written as V7#5, although it often contains both the natural and augmented 5th.</p>
<p>We lack enough examples of this inversion to make a rule, but the two examples here differ from the chopin chord as they both lack the seventh and take the form of b6/5/3 chords. This section needs to be re-analyzed and revised to take it into account, with possible links to harmonic major sonorities, V+ dominants, etc.</p>


<?php tt("Bach - Harpsichord Concerto in D (BWV 1054), Adagio") ?>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Sonata n°2") ?>

<p>Note the move iv°7 -> III+65 -> i over *4 -> *3 -> *1 bassline</p>

<?php yt("C_lOOYSzoBc", 30) ?>


<h5 class="elementExampleTitle">Third inversion: +642</h5>
<p>Another way to get the Maj7#5 chord is as an added dissonance to the I -> I+ -> vi (i.e. III -> III+ -> i) move that we have already explored in the article on augmented triads (see below). Instead of keeping the bass on *1, moving the bass to *7 while the rest of the harmony moves from I -> I+ yields the augmented major seventh chord in 642 inversion. In other words this uses the Maj7#5 sonority through I+/*7.</p>
<?php linkSingleElement('augmented_triads') ?>


<?php tt("Liszt - Sonata in B minor") ?>
<p>- At 23:59, middle row mm. 2 in B major: I -> I+/*7 = I+642 -> vi</p>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Symphony n°2, 3rd Mvt.") ?>
<p>- C -> C+|B -> Am i.e. I -> I+/*7 = I+642 -> vi</p>
<p>The same pattern is repeated in other keys like D -> D+ | C# -> Bm etc.</p>
<p>Also note the plain augmented triads motions like Am -> A+ -> D aka v -> V+ -> I.</p>

<h4 id="summary" class="elementExampleTitle">Summary</h4>
<p>The Maj7#5 and Maj9#5 chords are often used:</p>
<p>- In *M* on *4 resolving to ii6 or ii</p>
<p>- In *m* on b*3 coming from *2 or *4 by suspending dominant harmony i.e. <i>'mediant ninth chord'</i></p>
<p>- In *M* with I -> I+ -> vi over *1 -> *7 -> *6, compatible with first use: IV -> IV+/*3 -> ii</p>
