<p>The Maj7#5 or +Maj7 chord is a particularly dramatic chord that produces a striking effect. It can be obtained and conceptualized in many ways, the easiest being (in my opinion) as a minor RO suspension of the dominant chord on *4 or *2 moving to *3. If the whole chord is suspended the chord becomes Maj9#5, retaining the same highly dissonant sound. This also means we can get it by moving the bass to b*6 while keeping I harmony in major for a similar result. </p>
<p>Because this chord is often used in highly chromatic contexts, the roman numeral below will sometimes be given loosely (e.g. ~I -> ~vi6) to understand the local move.</p>
<p>While sometimes found in Romantic music, this sonority is often associated with French baroque composers such as Couperin.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Resolution</h4>

<p>The peculiar Maj7#5 chord and its inversion might seem daunting, but seems to resolve in the same way most of the time. The resolutions have been compiled by <a taget="_blank" href="https://bernardgreenberg.com/Scores/5954032">Bernard Greenberg</a> in the following graph.</p>

<br><br>
<p>An important addition is that in root position, the chord can also resolve down a third to a root position chord: IMaj7#5 -> vi. In all cases, the most important is to properly resolve the suspensions.</p>
<p>One important aspect to notice, as mentioned by Michael Koch, is that since the Maj7#5 chord can resolve down a third to a minor chord or directly to a minor chord of the sixth, it is very appropriate as a predominant in major: IVMaj7#5 -> ii(6) -> V -> I.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Other uses & inversions</h4>

<p>When inverted, the Maj7#5 chord - also written +Maj7 chord - becomes a +65 or +642. At this chord often naturally occurs on the *3 degree of the harmonic minor scale, it is often found as III+.</p>

<h5 class="elementExampleTitle">First inversion: +65</h5>

<?php tt("Bach - Harpsichord Concerto in D (BWV 1054), Adagio") ?>
<p>At 8:32 with the "#56" figured bass: D+65 (F# A# C# D) -> Bmin6</p>
<p>i.e. I+65 -> vi6</p>
<?php yt("V-Cgx-XokvY", 505) ?>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Sonata n°2") ?>
<p>At 0:30, second row (f# minor): III+65 -> i</p>
<p>Note the move iv°7 -> III+65 -> i over *4 -> *3 -> *1 bassline</p>

<?php yt("C_lOOYSzoBc", 30) ?>


<h5 class="elementExampleTitle">Third inversion: +642</h5>
<p>Another way to get the Maj7#5 chord is as an added dissonance to the I -> I+ -> vi (i.e. III -> III+ -> i) move that we have already explored in the article on augmented triads (see below). Instead of keeping the bass on *1, moving the bass to *7 while the rest of the harmony moves from I -> I+ yields the augmented major seventh chord in 642 inversion. In other words this uses the Maj7#5 sonority through I+/*7.</p>
<?php linkSingleElement('augmented_triads') ?>


<?php tt("Liszt - Sonata in B minor") ?>
<p>- At 23:59, middle row mm. 2 in B major: I -> I+/*7 = I+642 -> vi</p>
<p>- mm. 4: EMaj7#5</p>
<p>For more info on this example, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://musescore.com/user/30712651/scores/6981766">this</a></p>
<?php yt("IeKMMDxrsBE", 1439) ?>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Symphony n°2, 3rd Mvt.") ?>
<p>- C -> C+|B -> Am i.e. I -> I+/*7 = I+642 -> vi</p>
<p>The same pattern is repeated in other keys like D -> D+ | C# -> Bm etc.</p>
<p>Also note the other augmented triads motions like Am -> A+ -> D aka v -> V+ -> I.</p>
<?php yt("LoMXg5a3aD4") ?>



<?php tt("Bach - Violin Concerto in A Minor (BWV 1041), Andante") ?>
<p>- At 8:15, 'forte' measure: Dm -> E7642 -> CMaj7#5 -> Am6</p>
<p> i.e. 53 -> 6#42 -> +642 -> 6 over *1 -> *1 -> b*7 -> b*7</p>
<p>This move is a local suspension of the dominant chord over *4 -> *3 RO motion, and a useful trick to prolongate the "dominant tied bass"(see below) motion of 53 -> 6#42 -> 6 when moving to a minor key.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Summary</h4>
<p>The Maj7#5 and Maj9#5 chords are often used:</p>
<p>- In *M* on *4 resolving to ii6 or ii</p>
<p>- In *m* on b*3 coming from *2 or *4 by suspending dominant harmony i.e. <i>'mediant ninth chord'</i></p>
<p>- In *M* with I -> I+ -> vi over *1 -> *7 -> *6, compatible with first use: IV -> IV+/*3 -> ii</p>
<p>TODO: explore the other resolution mentioned by Greenberg</p>

<p>Note: in the comments of <a target="_blank" href="https://musescore.com/user/30712651/scores/6877907">this page</a>, some examples are given which, in my opinion, don't give the same sound but rather use the augmented 5th as a chromatic lower approach note. To be investigated...</p>
