<h3 id="vch" class="elementExampleTitle">'Chopin Chord'</h3>

<p>The Chopin Chord is a Dominant 7th chord with the added 13th (also called 6th) sometimes voiced in 4ths with ^4 ^7 ^3 in the soprano, or ^4 ^7 b^3 in minor. Most often, the 13th resolves down to the 5th (^3 -> ^2) and then the chord resolves like a normal dominant 7th chord in what is called the <i>"Chopin Cadence"</i>. The 6th/13th is an unprepared suspension. Note that the 5th (^2) is sometimes omitted. This chord is most often encountered in Major (VChM) but sometimes in minor too (VChm).</p>

<p>Note: this example is little more complex as we still have Db (*1) faintly sounding in the bass and the V chord in 642 inversion, but the sonority of the measure remains very similar, with the 13th/6th resolving down F -> Eb -> Db, with the VChM chord resolving to I as always. This is a mix of the VChM and <a href="index.php?filter=element&element=V_over_1">V over *1</a> sounds. We get it in root position at 1:05.</p>

<h3 id="vch9" class="elementExampleTitle">Chopin Chord with added 9th</h3>

<p>The (b)6-5 resolution of the Chopin Chord can be added to the nV9 or V7b9 chords, resulting in an even richer sound. Note that in this case, the ♮9 resolves down like a 'normal' nV9 more than up like the V9.</p>
<p>The chord can then be described as a V7((b)9, (b)13) chord. I seems that we mostly find V7(9, 13) and V7(b9, b13), respectively in major and minor, and not more dissonant/jazzy combinations like V7(9, b13) or V7(b9, 13), but I might be wrong. For simplicity, let's call them <i>'Chopin Ninth'</i> chords: VChM9 & VChmb9.</p>

<?php tt("Liszt - Consolation n°3")?>
<p>mm 3: C7 + Db (b9th) + Ab (b13) -> Fm i.e. VChmb9 -> i</p>
<?php yt("73_jSjG1WrY", 32) ?>

<?php tt("Chopin - Ballade n°1")?>
<p>- VChM9 First measure of the Meno Mosso: Bb(9,13): (Bb-D-F-Ab) make the dominant chord, C is the 9th and G is the 13th (i.e. 6th) resolving to Eb.</p>
<p>- VChM9 3rd measure of the Meno Mosso: (F-A-C-Eb) + G(9th)->F + D(13th)->Bb, first two beats can be also seen as 2 of 2-5-1 motion.
<p>- Same for mm. 2 at 3:40 and mm. 7 which ends with another classic VChM Chopin Chord.</p>
<?php yt("3QH8MstNkKg", 203) ?>

<?php tt("Sergei Lyapunov - Prelude Op. 6 n°6")?>
<p>VChM9 2nd row 2nd measure Eb7(9, 13): Eb7 (Eb-G-x-Db) + F (9th) + C (13th/6th), same next page mm. 5 with Gb7(9, 13)</p>
<p>Note: the difference made by the 9th is very subtle.</p>

<h4 id="vch9sus" class="elementExampleTitle">Adding a 4-3 suspension</h4>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">The video below mentions this chord, this time with a 4-3 suspension (hence the author calling it a Sus4(9,13). It is like the 4-3 suspension we find in compound cadences, or you can see it as the 2-5-1 <i>"box voicing"</i> in jazz. In C this voicing would be: Dmin9 (aka FMaj7/D), G7(9,13), C. If you had G in the bass instead of D, Fmaj7/G would be our Sus4(9,13) chord.</p>
<p><b>Keyboard playing tip:</b> As mentioned in the video, a simple way to play this chord is to put a <b>IVMaj7 (ivMin7 in minor, although I personally don't like the suspension in minor, I prefer using ivø7 i.e. Tristan chord or "Rachmaninoff's Subdominant") over *5 bass</b> (the author mentions iim7 but I don't think that's correct), then resolve the 5th of that chord a half step below to get the 4-3 suspension resolving to the VChM9 or VChmb9 chord. Ex. in C major: Fmaj7 over G: F (7th) - A (9th) - C (4->3sus) - E (13th/6th).</p>
