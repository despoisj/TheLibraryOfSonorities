<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Leading & Common Tone Diminished 7th Chords (LT°7 / CT°7)</h4>

<p>- Leading Tone Diminished 7th chords (LT°7) are diminished 7th chords built on the leading tone of the scale, often leading back to the tonic: LT°7 -> I.</p>
<p>- Common Tone Diminished 7th chords (CT°7) are diminished 7th chords build with a common tone with the root of the previous/following chord, in many cases as a prolongation of the tonic through a I -> CT°7 -> I or dominant through a V(7) -> VCT°7 -> V(7).</p>


<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>

<?php tt("Alexandre Boëly - Romance Op. 20, No. 7") ?>
<p>2nd row, mm 3-4: A major -> A°7 -> ~ A major, i.e I -> ICT°7 -> I</p>
<?php yt("eAVG0f_4IKI", 18) ?>


<?php tt("Tchaikovsky - Waltz of the Flowers") ?>
<p>mm 1-2: A -> A°7 -> A, i.e. I -> ICT°7 -> I</p>

<?php tt("John Field - Nocturne n°5") ?>
<p>B -> B°7 -> B, i.e. I -> ICT°7 -> I then I -> LT°7 -> I</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">W.I.P. Examples</h4>

<?php tt("Sergei Bortkievicz - Prelude Op. 33 n°7") ?>
<p>- 2nd measure: F# -> F#°7 (with added E# -> D#) -> F#</p>
<p>- Same at 1:54, 2nd measure: F# -> ~ F#°7 (with E# -> D#) -> F#</p>
<p>Note: I'm not 100% sure for that one because E# contributes a lot to the sound, but it is very similar. We can find a similar chord in the Mozkowski concerto (see below).</p>
<?php yt("hDtDq4GmLqU", 11) ?>

<?php tt("Moritz Moszkowski - Piano Concerto in E Major, Andante") ?>
<p>4th measure: C#m63 -> B#°7/E# (with added B -> A) -> C#m63 -> B#°7 -> C#m</p>
<p>i.e I6 -> LT°7 inverted (with added B -> A) -> I6 -> LT°7 (with added G# -> F#) -> I</p>
<p>Like for the Bortkievicz example, we have a diminished seventh (here LT°7) with an extra note in a melody. In both case the note is a whole step above one of the chord tones - which is a common practice for tensions in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chords/available-tensions/">jazz</a> - and resolves down by step. It might be interesting to investigate more.</p>
