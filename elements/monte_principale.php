<p>The <i>Monte Principale</i> (Gjerdingen) is a sequence that is defined by 53 chords over a bass that leaps up a fourth and down a third (U4D3). It can also be seen as a series of V-I relations that climbs up a step, especially since it is often used to repeat a musical idea that spans two chords, and then repeated higher.</p>
<p>It is important to note the similarity with other sequences such as the 5-6 diatonic monte and the '8-7-6'. The sonority of the Monte principale is also very similar / hard to distinguish from its weak/strong beat opposite that rises by sixth and falls by fifth: the U6D5 or <i>DoLaReTi</i> (Mortensen). I will call both Monte Principale here.</p>
<p>The Monte Principale was frequently used in Baroque and Classical music, but it can be found in Romantic music where its rising motion is used to swell and build up energy while approaching the climax of a section. In romantic or more modern music, the chords are often embellished with extensions like the 7th.</p>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Sonata for Cello and Piano Op. 19, 3rd Mvt.")?>
<p>At 1:10, [iim7 -> V7] -> [iiim7 -> vim7]</p>
<?php yt("IuK4g1MMzDI", 70) ?>

<?php tt("Fauré - Requiem, Libera Me")?>
<p>At 0:44, Bass follows: [F -> Bb] -> [G -> C] -> [A -> D] -> [B♮ -> E]</p>
<p>i.e. [*3 -> *6] -> [*4 -> *7] -> [*5 -> *1] -> [#*6 -> *2]</p>
<p>The harmony is (in Dm) [III7 -> VIMaj7] -> [ivmin7 -> ~nVII9] -> [vø7 -> I7b9] -> [#viø7 -> II7], i.e. (in F) [I7 -> IVMaj7] -> [iimin7 -> ~nV9] -> [iiiø7 -> VI7b9] -> [#ivø7 -> VII7]</p>

<?php tt("Ādolfs Skulte - Arietta")?>
<p>At 1:36 we get a series of rising ii-V motion with rich 7th harmonies, but we don't get the up and down motion of the bass, every second beat is omitted, giving a smooth rising bassline.</p>
<p>In jazz music, this is often done with circle of fifth progressions as well for smoother voice leading, alternating between root position and 43 inversions.</p>
<?php yt("v8VBiRfFrsI", 96) ?>

<?php tt("Mozart - Ave Verum Corpus")?>
<p>Bass goes: [*1 -> *4] -> [*2 -> *5] -> [*3 -> *6]</p>
<?php yt("Af0x8EsiR7Q", 106) ?>


<?php tt("Mozart - Madamina")?>
<p>Bass goes: x D] -> [B -> E] -> [C# -> F#] -> [D x</p>
<p>i.e. x *1] -> [*6 -> *2] -> [*7 -> *3] -> [*1 x</p>
<p>This is a good example of the link between the 5-6 monte and the Monte Principale.</p>
<?php yt("YmEHs7MKYMg", 3) ?>

<?php tt("Handel - Concerto Grosso Op. 6 n°12, Allegro")?>
<p>This example shows the 5-6, which is very similar to the Monte Principale.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Modern Examples</h4>
<p>The following examples are more modern, but show the same rising energy of the Monte Principale.</p>

<?php tt("Theodore Servin  - Ballade in F# minor") ?>
<p>At 0:34, 2nd row, mm. 3-6: Bass follows [B -> E] -> [C# -> F#] -> [D x</p>
<p>i.e. [*4 -> *7] -> [*5 -> *1] -> [*6 x</p>
<p>The harmony is [ivm7 -> ~VII7] -> [vø7 -> I7] -> VI</p>
<?php yt("ZC7GleTGtkY", 34) ?>

<?php tt("Michael Nyman  - Chasing Sheep is Best Left to Shepherds") ?>
<p>mm. 4-7: Bass follows: x G] -> [E -> A] -> [F -> B]</p>
<p>i.e. *5] -> [*3 -> *6] -> [*4 -> *7]</p>
<p>The harmony is V -> [iii -> vi] -> [IV -> vii°]</p>
<p>Note that we could even include the chord mm. 3 that is IV (F), a substitute to ii, which gives us what is called the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_road_progression">Royal Road Progression</a>.</p>

<?php tt("Frank Sinatra - My Way") ?>
<p>At 3:12 (and before at 1:44), try to listen for the building energy with the Up and Down motion: THINGS↑ -> feels↓ -> WORDS↑ -> kneels↓.</p>
