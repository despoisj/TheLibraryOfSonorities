<p>The <i>Monte Principale</i> (Gjerdingen) is a sequence that is defined by 53 chords over a bass that leaps up a fourth and down a third (U4D3). It can also be seen as a series of V-I relations that climbs up a step, especially since it is often used to repeat a musical idea that spans two chords, and then repeated higher.</p>
<p>It is important to note the similarity with the 5-6 diatonic monte and its complementarity to the '8-7-6'. The sonority of the Monte principale is also very similar & hard to distinguish from its weak/strong beat opposite that rises by sixth and falls by fifth: the U6D5 or <i>DoLaReTi</i> (Mortensen), I will call both of them Monte Principale. All three bass motion fall in the same family and result in a similar sound.</p>
<p>The Monte Principale was frequently used in Baroque and Classical music, but it can be found in Romantic music where its rising motion is used to swell and build up energy while approaching the climax of a section. In romantic or more modern music, the chords are often embellished with extensions like the 7th.</p>

<?php tt("Beethoven - Piano Concerto n°5, Op. 73, 2nd Mvt.")?>
<p>At 21:55, a prime example of the Monte Principale: [Bmaj -> Emaj] -> [C#min -> F#maj] -> [D#min -> G#min]</p>

<p>At 0:44, Bass follows: [F -> Bb] -> [G -> C] -> [A -> D] -> [B♮ -> E]</p>
<p>i.e. [*3 -> *6] -> [*4 -> *7] -> [*5 -> *1] -> [#*6 -> *2]</p>
<p>The harmony is (in Dm) [III7 -> VIMaj7] -> [ivmin7 -> ~nVII9] -> [vø7 -> I7b9] -> [#viø7 -> II7], i.e. (in F) [I7 -> IVMaj7] -> [iimin7 -> ~nV9] -> [iiiø7 -> VI7b9] -> [#ivø7 -> VII7]</p>
<?php yt("ot4ulSeYcHU", 44) ?>

<?php tt("Ādolfs Skulte - Arietta")?>
<p>At 1:36 we get a series of rising ii-V motion with rich 7th harmonies, but we don't get the up and down motion of the bass, every second beat is omitted, giving a smooth rising bassline.</p>
<p>In jazz music, this is often done with circle of fifth progressions as well for smoother voice leading, alternating between root position and 43 inversions.</p>
<?php yt("v8VBiRfFrsI", 96) ?>

<p>At 4:38 the bass follows [A -> D] -> [B -> E] with harmony [iv -> VII7] -> [vm -> I7]</p>

<?php yt("C8EIBhKxGVY", 308) ?>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff — Piano Concerto n°3, 3rd Mvt.")?>
<p>Note: Buckle up for this example, as romantic composers use dense harmonies and uneven segment lengths to decorate and disguise sequences, similar to Dobrowen's example below. The upwards pull of the stepwise climbing of the melody is the signature sound of this family of sonorities.</p>
<p>At 2:00, the sequence starts with a DoLaReTi bass Monte Principale, which takes modal detours to create iiø7-V7-iii progressions borrowed from a minor Monte Principale with U4D3 bass.</p>
<p>Gmaj -> Emin -> Amin (-> Aø7 -> D7) -> Bmin (-> Bø7 -> E7) -> Aø7</p>
<p>i.e *1] -> [*6 -> *2] (-> local *2 -> *5) -> [*7 -> (-> local *2 -> *5) -> *2</p>
<p>i.e. in terms of DoLaReTi and MP building blocks: DoLaReTi (*1 *6 *2) -> MP (*1 -> *4 -> *2) -> MP (*1 -> *4 -> *2)</p>
<?php yt("wkci_fyEot8", 120) ?>

<br>
<p>This sequence returns at the end of the piece for the culmination of the concerto, and is very nicely illustrated in the video below, even if the notation in roman numerals isn't the best to see what's going on. The two notable elements are the chain of DoLaReTi with U4D3 Monte Principale components as well as the transition from a minor chord to a half-diminished chord with the same root.</p>

<p>This can be seen as the DoLaReTi (Up a sixth down a fifth) or an offset Monte Principale (Up a fourth down a third), which sound very similar.</p>
