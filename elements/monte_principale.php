<p>The <i>Monte Principale</i> (Gjerdingen) is a sequence that is defined by 53 chords over a bass that leaps up a fourth and down a third (U4D3). It can also be seen as a series of V-I relations that climbs up a step, especially since it is often used to repeat a musical idea that spans two chords, and then repeated higher.</p>
<p>It is important to note the similarity with the 5-6 diatonic monte and its complementarity to the '8-7-6'. The sonority of the Monte principale is also very similar & hard to distinguish from its weak/strong beat opposite that rises by sixth and falls by fifth: the U6D5 or <i>DoLaReTi</i> (Mortensen), I will call both of them Monte Principale. All three bass motion fall in the same family and result in a similar sound.</p>
<p>The Monte Principale was frequently used in Baroque and Classical music, but it can be found in Romantic music where its rising motion is used to swell and build up energy while approaching the climax of a section. In romantic or more modern music, the chords are often embellished with extensions like the 7th.</p>

<p>The harmony is (in Dm) [III7 -> VIMaj7] -> [ivmin7 -> ~nVII9] -> [vø7 -> I7b9] -> [#viø7 -> II7], i.e. (in F) [I7 -> IVMaj7] -> [iimin7 -> ~nV9] -> [iiiø7 -> VI7b9] -> [#ivø7 -> VII7]</p>

<?php tt("Ādolfs Skulte - Arietta")?>
<p>At 1:36 we get a series of rising ii-V motion with rich 7th harmonies, but we don't get the up and down motion of the bass, every second beat is omitted, giving a smooth rising bassline.</p>
<p>In jazz music, this is often done with circle of fifth progressions as well for smoother voice leading, alternating between root position and 43 inversions.</p>
