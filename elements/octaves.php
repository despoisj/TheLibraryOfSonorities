<p>What I call <i>Lyric Octave Chords</i> or <i>Concerto Octaves</i> is a technique where a melody is played in the right hand with an octave that is filled in with chord tones to make it fuller. This technique gives a much richer sound than traditional 'naked' octaves passages. The inner notes often do not change for every change in melody, which results in a very lush and rich sound often fond in piano concertos where big chords (often with two hands) make the piano stand out for the climax. To make it easier to play, or lighten the sound, one can choose to sometimes hold or skip the chord notes instead of restriking them every beat. This technique is prominently used by Late-Romantic composers.</p>
<p>Note: The name is inspired from <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ec-FrnaU0rs?si=QcC5X-JVNjNE52Z9&t=113">this interview</a> where legendary jazz pianist Oscar Peterson talks about the style of Erroll Garner. Despite classical 'concerto' sound and jazz sound being quite different, the technique is the same - with additions of tremolo, syncopation and grace notes for Erroll's style.</p>

<p><b>Practice tips:</b> try picking a chord and moving up and down the scale while keeping as many notes of the chord as you can.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Prelude Op. 23 n°5")?>
<p>At 1:25, the middle section starts on a D7 chord. The right hand plays A A B C B A in octaves while keeping the D and F#.</p>
<p>The next bar it's Aø7, then D7 again etc. The whole middle section of this prelude uses this technique a lot.</p>
<?php yt("I2GKgFZ_ioQ", 88) ?>

<?php tt("Ravel - Ondine")?>
<p>At 3:39, the climax is prepared with a rising scale played in octave chords. Notice the ligatures indicating that the chord tones are only changed every 2 beats except for the very last bar of the build up.</p>
<?php yt("T_-1qMPDf-A", 219) ?>

<?php tt("Sergei Bortkiewicz - Prelude Op. 40 n°4")?>
<p>At 0:22, 2nd row 1st bar, the whole bar sustains a iim7 i.e. G#m7 (or m9) chord with a chord melody.</p>
<p>Note: here the melody isn't in octave, but the result is very similar.</p>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Piano Concerto n°2, 3rd Mvt.")?>
<p>At 29:05</p>
<?php yt("gRd0SGny3JY", 1745) ?>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Piano Concerto n°3, 1st Mvt.")?>
<p>At 12:04</p>
<?php yt("fDblE1CcrR4", 724) ?>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Piano Concerto n°3, 3rd Mvt.")?>
<p>At 12:29</p>
<?php yt("wkci_fyEot8", 749) ?>

<?php tt("Debussy - Clair de Lune")?>
<p>At 1:00</p>
<?php yt("FoD_AxKoJDs", 62) ?>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Prelude Op. 23 n°4")?>
<p>At 3:20</p>
<?php yt("1qoPDQzXVmk", 200) ?>

<?php tt("Anatoly Lyadov - Prelude in Db major, Op. 57 n°1")?>
<p>At 7:55</p>
<?php yt("GDBYoLPFAkk", 475) ?>

<?php tt("Grieg - Piano Concerto in A minor")?>
<p>At 3:20</p>
<?php yt("Ozn4C3AmEi0", 199) ?>

<?php tt("Erroll Garner plays 'Be My Love'")?>
<p>At 0:19, despite Erroll Garner being a jazz pianist, here playing a jazz standard, this piece shows just how blurry the line can be between genres, and is a great example of lyric octave chords.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Comparison with 'Naked' Octaves</h4>

<?php tt("Sergei Bortkiewicz - Piano Concerto n°1, 1st Mvt.")?>
<p>At 2:26, we get first a passage with naked double octaves, then immediately after lyric octave chords, which sound much more romantic and full.</p>
<?php yt("sbBrKano384", 146) ?>

<?php tt("Tchaikovsky - Piano Concerto n°1, 1st Mvt.")?>
<p>At 1:10, note how much lighter the octave melody sound, despite being a double octave!</p>
<?php yt("NUaxBavIBDk", 70) ?>

<?php tt("Chopin - Piano Concerto n°1, 2nd Mvt.")?>
<p>At 6:49, the naked octaves give a very pure sound to the melody.</p>
