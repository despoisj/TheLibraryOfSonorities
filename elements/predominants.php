<h3 id="pre" class="elementExampleTitle">Predominants & Predominant Extensions</h3>

<p>In this section, we will explore some <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predominant_chord#:~:text=In%20music%20theory%2C%20a%20predominant,and%20secondary%20leading%20tone%20chord.">predominant chords</a> that can be found in Romantic harmony.</p>
<p>In particular, we will focus on what I call <i>predominant extensions</i>: extended dominant harmonies that can be easily constructed like the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_structure">upper structure triads</a> found in jazz. The concept is simple: add a specific chord on top of a V7 chord (or simply *5 bass note) to create a richer harmony. This concept is very rarely explored, and I hope you will find the selection below as useful and beautiful as I do.</p>
<p>The main advantage of building chords this way is that it allows you to move the voices quickly: it's not that easy to quickly play and move voices of a V7b9 chord, but it's easy to move a vii°7 on top of a *5 bassline. Also note that when a predominant can be built with *4 in the bass, this allows the bass to move up to *5 without changing the upper harmony, like a suspension. Here's some of the most interesting combinations:</p>

<h3 id="a" class="elementExampleTitle">ii, IV, viiø7, iim7</h3>
<div style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><small>*M*</small></div>
<p>In major, iim7 and iim65 are very common, with iim65 being the Rule of the Octave on *4.</p>
<p>A nice move is to go from iim65 to iim7 with a wedge motion: iim65 = (*4 ^6 ^8 ^2) -> (*3 ^6 ^8 ^3) -> iim7 = (*2 ^6 ^8 ^4).</p>
<p><b>PREDOMINANT EXTENSION:</b> when using ii or viiø7 on top of *5, you get a nV9 chord with or without the third. You get the opportunity to resolve the chord either down to V7, or by bringing the 9th up in a V9 Dream Cadence. When using IV or iim7, the chord becomes nV11, which resolves either down to V7, or by bringing the upper third up in a V11 Dream Cadence.</p>
<p>Note: even though you can freely move between the inversions of ii and iim7, the best effect is usually when the 9th (or 11th) is the highest voice. To learn more about the Dream Cadence, see here:</p>

<div style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><small>*m*</small></div>
<p><b>PREDOMINANT EXTENSION:</b> when using ii° or vii°7 on top of *5, you get a V7b9 chord with or without the third. The b9 usually resolves down to V7. See the dedicated article for more information and examples.</p>

<br>
<?php linkSingleElement("V7b9_chord") ?>

<br>
<h3 id="c" class="elementExampleTitle">iv & iiø7</h3>
<div style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><small>*M* & *m*</small></div>
<p>This is the equivalent of the iim7 and iim65 but for a minor mode resolution. Likewise, the outer voice wedge sounds great: iiø65 = (*4 b^6 ^8 ^2) -> (b*3 b^6 ^8 b^3) -> iiø7 = (*2 b^6 ^8 ^4).</p>
<p>One important use of the iiø65 chord is borrowed in major to give a <a href="index.php?filter=element&element=harmonic_major">harmonic major</a> sound. This is also a possibility for the predominant extension.</p>
<p><b>PREDOMINANT EXTENSION:</b> when using IV or iiø65 on top of V7, you get a V7 chord with a b9th and an 11th. On top of a simple *5, the third is missing.</p>

<p>Note: iim65, iim65 / *5, iiø65, and iiø65 / *5 can resolve to V7 or directly to i or I in a plagal cadence. See <a href="https://musescore.com/user/30712651/scores/7185111" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="d" class="elementExampleTitle">IVM7 & iim9</h3>
<div style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><small>*M*</small></div>
<p>In itself, using IVM7 instead of ii, IV, iim7 or iim65 gives a very sweet rich sound. For this, the 7th is often prepared.</p>

<br>
<p><b>PREDOMINANT EXTENSION:</b> when using IVM7 on top of V7 or *5, you get an incredible V7sus chord with a 9th and a 13th. The suspension, ^1, often resolves down to ^7 to form a VChM9 chord, which can resolve to V7 or directly move to I. This can be combined with the iim7 extension to form an even richer iim9 extension sound, even though the 5th of the dominant chord isn't that important.</p>
<p>A common resolution for this chord is to resolve the suspension first to get a VChM9 chord, which can then resolve to V7 or directly to I. It is like the 4-3 suspension we find in compound cadences, or you can see it as the 2-5-1 <i>"box voicing"</i> in jazz. In C this voicing would be: Dmin9 (aka FMaj7/D), G7(9,13), C. If you had G in the bass instead of D, Fmaj7/G would be our Sus4(9,13) chord.</p>

<h3 id="e" class="elementExampleTitle">ivm7 & ivø7</h3>
<div style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><small>*m*</small></div>
<p>Using ivm7 instead of iv gives a very rich sound for which the 7th is often prepared. Another possibility is to create an ivAdd9 chord by preparing the 9th, or more rarely a full ivm9 chord.</p>
<p>Another option for a predominant chord in minor, much more dissonant, is to use the ivø7 chord. For more information, check out the article below.</p>

<br>
<p><b>PREDOMINANT EXTENSION:</b> when using ivm7 on top of V7 or *5, you get an incredible V7sus chord with a b9th and a b13th. Like for IV, the suspension ^7 resolves to form a VChmb9 chord (aka ivø7 extension), which can then resolve to V7 or directly move to i.</p>
<p>Note: I personally find the ivm7 extension to be a bit too muddy, so I often skip the suspension and use ivø7 instead.</p>
