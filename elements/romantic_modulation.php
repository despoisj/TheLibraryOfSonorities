<p>This modulation, which I call 'romantic mediant' modulation because of its prevalence in the Romantic Era, moves from I to bVI, or from any major chord to the <b>major scale a major third below</b> (ex. Cmaj -> Abmaj). Most of the time, this modulation is done directly, without having to tonicize the new key. Because bVI is not in the original key, this is one of the chromatic mediant modulations.</p>
<p>The romantic modulation often brings an unexpected sweet sound, which I why I have only selected pieces where the change is rather sudden. In other pieces we find the same modulation between sections, but if the change is too gradual, the effect is much less pronounced.</p>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">V -> bVI and I64 -> bV6</h4>

<p>A very similar sonority is the one brought by the deceptive cadence of the minor mode, where V goes to bVI. This can be borrowed in the major mode as well. Another variant that gives the same semitone up jump to major is to move from I64 to bII64.</p>

<?php tt("Nikolai Tcherepnin - Prelude Op.18 n°3") ?>
<p>At 0:34, G#min64 -> D#7 -> EMaj i.e i64 -> V -> bVI</p>

<p>i.e i -> ii°6 -> I64 -> I64/bII -> V7/bII -> Resolves as Augmented 6th</p>
<p>Note: the shift from a minor cadence to EMaj64 has a very interesting sonority too.</p>
