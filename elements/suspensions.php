<p><a target="_blank" href="https://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/Suspension.html">Suspensions</a> are accented non-chord tones occurring on downbeats. Traditionally, suspensions had to be prepared but romantic composers sometimes break free of that constraint.</p>
<p>W.I.P: This article isn't complete, and I chose to focus on some distinctive and very expressive romantic suspensions.</p>

<h3 id="wss" class="elementExampleTitle">Whole Step Suspensions (WSS)</h3>

<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chords/available-tensions/">jazz theory</a>, it is common practice to enrich Diminished 7th chords such as CT°7 or LT°7 by adding notes that are one whole step up from any of the chord tones. For exemple on a C°7 chord you can add any of D, F, G# or B - a.k.a. notes from a D°7 chord. In romantic music, these additional dissonances are often treated as suspensions by resolving down by step. I call these Whole Step Suspensions, or WSS.</p>
<p>For maximum effect, the suspensions is played as the highest note of the melody and extended in duration, with the resolution arriving late.</p>
<p>Note: this borrows notes from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale">Whole-Half diminished scale</a>, also known as the Octatonic scale.</p>


<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>

<?php tt("Sergei Bortkievicz - Prelude Op. 33 n°7") ?>
<p>- 3nd measure: F# -> F#°7 (with added E# -> D#) -> F# i.e. I -> CT°7 + WSS -> I</p>
<p>- Same at 1:54, 2nd measure: F# -> ~ F#°7 (with E# -> D#) -> F#</p>
<?php yt("hDtDq4GmLqU", 11) ?>

<?php tt("Moritz Moszkowski - Piano Concerto in E Major, Andante") ?>
<p>4th measure: C#m63 -> B#°7/E# (with added B -> A) -> C#m63 -> B#°7 -> C#m</p>
<p>i.e i6 -> LT°7 inverted + WSS -> i6 -> LT°7 + WSS -> i</p>
<?php yt("eh3l8I-JT4Q", 980) ?>

<?php tt("Edward MacDowell - 4 Little Poems, Op. 32 n°1") ?>
<p>mm. 2: B#°7 (with G# -> F#)</p>
<p>i.e B#°7 + WSS</p>
<?php yt("rquTU4lzc4g", 16) ?>

<?php tt("Grieg - Lyric Pieces Op. 12 n°1 'Arietta'")?>
<p>*M* mm. 1-2: Eb -> Ab°7 / Eb (with G -> F) -> Eb</p>
<p>i.e. I -> LT°7 + WSS / *1 -> I.</p>
<?php yt("7IYEUiKh-48") ?>



<h3 class="elementExampleTitle">(W.I.P) Suspensions on Half-Diminished Chords</h3>

<p>Some suspensions on Half-Diminished chords sound absolutely amazing, but it seems to be very contextual. For example, on i -> ivø7 we can add WSS and it works great, but if you try i -> iiø65 + E♮ it sounds awful, but borrowing any note from i scale works great.</p>

<?php tt("Rachmaninoff - Prelude Op. 32 n°12") ?>
<p>mm. 1 of 2nd page: G#m -> C#ø7/E (with D# -> C#)</p>
<p>i.e i -> ivø65 + WSS</p>
<?php yt("13UlKWgwdZI", 27) ?>

<?php tt("Brahms - Prelude Op. 32 n°12") ?>
<p>Over the iiø65 chord, we find alternatively G and Bb, which are WSS</p>
<p>Note: in this context, any note from the i scale works well (with Eb which is NOT a WSS).</p>
<?php yt("g9kCOzZ7h2M") ?>

<h3 class="elementExampleTitle">(W.I.P) Other usual suspensions</h3>

<p>Among other very poignant romantic suspensions, we can note the 9th added to a minor triad, to iiø65 or iiø7 like just above, or to the Neapolitan Sixth chord.</p>
