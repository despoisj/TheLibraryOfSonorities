<p><a target="_blank" href="https://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/Suspension.html">Suspensions</a> are accented non-chord tones occurring on downbeats. Traditionally, suspensions had to be prepared but romantic composers sometimes break free of that constraint.</p>
<p>W.I.P: This article isn't complete, and I chose to focus on some distinctive and very expressive romantic suspensions.</p>

<h3 id="wss" class="elementExampleTitle">Whole Step Suspensions (WSS)</h3>

<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chords/available-tensions/">jazz theory</a>, it is common practice to enrich Diminished (and Half-Diminished) 7th chords by adding notes that are one whole step up from any of the chord tones. For exemple on a C°7 chord you can add any of D, F, G# or B - a.k.a. notes from a D°7 chord. In romantic music, these additional dissonances are often treated as suspensions by resolving down by step. I call these Whole Step Suspensions, or WSS.</p>
<p>For maximum effect, the suspensions is played as the highest note of the melody.</p>
<p>Note: on Diminished 7th chords, this borrows notes from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale">Whole-Half diminished scale</a>, also known as the Octatonic scale. For Half-Diminished chords, the related scale is the Locrian #2.</p>
