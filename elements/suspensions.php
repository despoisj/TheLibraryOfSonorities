<p><a target="_blank" href="https://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/Suspension.html">Suspensions</a> are accented non-chord tones occurring on downbeats. Traditionally, suspensions had to be prepared but romantic composers sometimes break free of that constraint.</p>
<p>W.I.P: This article isn't complete, and I chose to focus on some distinctive and very expressive romantic suspensions.</p>

<h3 id="wss" class="elementExampleTitle">Whole Step Suspensions (WSS)</h3>

<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chords/available-tensions/">jazz theory</a>, it is common practice to enrich Diminished (and Half-Diminished) 7th chords by adding notes that are one whole step up from any of the chord tones. For exemple on a C°7 chord you can add any of D, F, G# or B - a.k.a. notes from a D°7 chord. In romantic music, these additional dissonances are often treated as suspensions by resolving down by step. I call these Whole Step Suspensions, or WSS.</p>
<p>For maximum effect, the suspensions is played as the highest note of the melody.</p>
<p>Note: on Diminished 7th chords, this borrows notes from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale">Whole-Half diminished scale</a>, also known as the Octatonic scale. For Half-Diminished chords, the related scale is the Locrian #2.</p>


<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">Examples</h4>

<?php tt("Sergei Bortkievicz - Prelude Op. 33 n°7") ?>
<p>- 3nd measure: F# -> F#°7 (with added E# -> D#) -> F# i.e. I -> CT°7 + WSS -> I</p>
<p>- Same at 1:54, 2nd measure: F# -> ~ F#°7 (with E# -> D#) -> F#</p>
<?php yt("hDtDq4GmLqU", 11) ?>

<?php tt("Moritz Moszkowski - Piano Concerto in E Major, Andante") ?>
<p>*m* 4th measure: C#m63 -> B#°7/E# (with added B -> A) -> C#m63 -> B#°7 -> C#m</p>
<p>i.e i6 -> LT°7 inverted + WSS -> i6 -> LT°7 + WSS -> i</p>
<?php yt("eh3l8I-JT4Q", 980) ?>

<?php tt("Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude Op. 32 n°12") ?>
<p>mm. 1 of 2nd page: G#m -> C#ø7/E (with D# -> C#)</p>
<p>i.e i -> ivø65 + WSS</p>
<?php yt("13UlKWgwdZI", 27) ?>

<h4 class="elementExampleTitle">(W.I.P) What to avoid</h4>
<p>In some cases, the half diminished suspensions of ^2 -> ^1 can sound very harsh. For example i -> iiø65 + E♮ sounds awful, while i -> ivø65 + G sounds great. This might come from the harsh dissonant sound of the ivø65 chord that accepts the dissonance, or because of E♮ in minor that doesn't work? To investigate...</p>
