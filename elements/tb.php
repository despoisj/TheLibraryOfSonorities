<h3 id="tb" class="elementExampleTitle">The Tied Bass</h3>

<p>The Tied Bass is the gesture of following a consonant chord on a given bass by a disonnant 642 chord on the same bass note. The bass note is then considered to be the dissonance and must resolve down by step, usually to a chord of the 6th, 6/5, or a 7th chord.</p>
<p>Note: this sequence is related to the <a href="index.php?filter=element&element=stepwise_leo">Stepwise Romanesca</a> and <i>"Cascade/U2D3" sequence</i>, with only a change in the way the bass moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 40px;">There are multiple sonorities derived from this, especially in the tied bass sequence, or "42 - 6" sequence. The main factors are: whether you start on a major or minor sound, which 642 chord you pick, and to which bass - ↓1 or ↓2 Half Step(s) - and sound you resolve it, see in the examples below. The most used chords are 6/4/2, b6/4/2, 6/#4/2 "dominant", b6/4/b2 "neapolitan".</p>
<p>There are endless combinations of starting chord, 6/4/2 chord and resolutions, and so far all my attempts to map out the good/possible outcomes have been vain. If you have a good system, I'd love to know about it.</p>
<p>The best simplification I could find - from the examples - is to stick to the combinations that exist in diatonic TB sequences, and see the different variations as modulations. For instance, I -> 6/#4/2 is like going on a TB chain in V, and I -> 6/4/2 -> Major 6 ↓2HS as a TB chain in IV. We could explore if more radical changes modulations are possible, such as I -> b6/4/b2 -> ???.</p>

<?php tt("Samuel Maykapar - Arietta in a minor")?>
<p>mm 3-: TB sequence using 642 and 65 chords. This creates a sound very similar to the circle of fifth sequence.</p>
<p>Here, like many minor sequences, we need the leading tone to stay in the key, otherwise they melt away into the relative major.</p>

<h3 id="domtb" class="elementExampleTitle">The 'Dominant' Tied Bass</h3>

<p>The tied bass motion can also be tonicizing, in what I call the 'Dominant' Tied Bass, which makes use of a V642 chord (6/#4/2), often to modulate.</p>

<?php tt("J.S. Bach - Prelude in C minor, BWV 921")?>
<p>mm. 2-: Minor 53 -> 6/#4/2 -> Minor 6 ↓2HS</p>
<?php yt("mn6b-hD_af8", 24) ?>

<?php tt("J.S. Bach - Brandenburg Concerto n°3")?>

<h3 id="morte" class="elementExampleTitle">The Morte Tied Bass</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/eighteenth-century-music/article/morte-a-galant-voiceleading-schema-as-emblem-of-lament-and-compositional-buildingblock/2CFE5B5CCA0E3F5FA06E07E6943606BD?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark" target="_blank">Morte</a> is a schema including diverging lines as well as specific harmonic beats. In particular, it contains the move from i to I7/b*7, sometimes direct or with a chord on *7 inbetween. This move is what I call 'Morte' Dominant Tied Bass, which goes from i to iv through I7. In roman numerals you can spot it as i -> V42/iv, i.e. i -> I7/b*7.</p>

<h3 id="other" class="elementExampleTitle">Other Uses</h3>

<?php tt("Chopin - Nocturne Op. 48 n°1")?>
<p>At 5:08 there's a similar sound, this time the dominant 6/#4/2 sound is triggered a half step below, here from a minor 53.</p>
<p>At 9:54 we have it again starting from a major 53: V -> V42/N -> N6</p>
<p>To easily get the V -> V/N sound, use contrary motion: lower the bass by 1 HS and raise the chord by 1HS. Note that V/N is the key's Augmented 6th chord, here in inversion.</p>
<?php yt("u0yREiMOY1I", 308) ?>

<?php tt("Thomas Tellefsen - Nocturne n°3 in G Minor, Op. 17")?>
<p>At 3:27, same as above, last row: Fmin -> F#642 -> Eb7</p>
<p>Note this special resolution of the 6/#4/2 chord while the bass still drops by step as it should.</p>
