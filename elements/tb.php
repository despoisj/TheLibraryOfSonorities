<p>The Tied Bass is the action of following a consonant chord on a given bass by a disonnant 642 chord on the same bass note. The bass note is then considered to be the dissonance and must resolve down by step, usually to a chord of the 6th, 6/5, or a 7th chord.</p>
<p>Note: this is very similar to the <a href="index.php?filter=element&element=stepwise_leo">Stepwise Romanesca</a> schema, as well as the <i>"Cascade/U2D3" sequence</i>, with only a change in the way the bass moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 40px;">There are multiple sonorities derived from this, especially in the tied bass sequence, or "42 - 6" sequence. The main factors are: whether you start on a major or minor sound, which 642 chord you pick, and to which bass - ↓1 or ↓2 Half Step(s) - and sound you resolve it, see in the examples below. The most used chords are 6/4/2, b6/4/2, 6/#4/2 "dominant", b6/4/b2 "neapolitan".</p>
<p>There are endless combinations of starting chord, 6/4/2 chord and resolutions, and so far all my attempts to map out the good/possible outcomes have been vain. If you have a good system, I'd love to know about it.</p>
<p>The best simplification I could find - from the examples - is to stick to the combinations that exist in diatonic TB sequences, and see the different variations as modulations. For instance, I -> 6/#4/2 is like going on a TB chain in V, and I -> 6/4/2 -> Major 6 ↓2HS as a TB chain in IV. We could explore if more radical changes modulations are possible, such as I -> b6/4/b2 -> ???.</p>

<?php tt("J.S. Bach - Prelude in C minor, BWV 921")?>
<p>mm. 2-: Minor 53 -> 6/#4/2 -> Minor 6 ↓2HS</p>
<p>Note: This one can't be nicely explained by modulation alone, as we would need to see it as a tiny modulation to G Major. This special case is what Professor John Mortensen calls "3 - 6/#4/2 - 6", where a stepwise descending bassline is harmonized with alternative chords of the 5th and 6th. Each chord of the 5th starts a short 6/#4/2 TB. This sound belongs to the Tied Bass family, and I find it particularly striking when starting on a minor chord.</p>

<?php tt("Samuel Maykapar - Arietta in a minor")?>
<p>mm 3-: TB sequence using 642 and 65 chords. This creates a sound very similar to the circle of fifth sequence.</p>
<p>Here, like many minor sequences, we need the leading tone to stay in the key, otherwise they melt away into the relative major.</p>

<?php tt("Tchaikovsky/Pletnev - 'Pas de Deux' (Nutcracker Suite)")?>
<p>-2nd row: Em -> EDom42 -> A6</p>
<p>i.e. Minor 53 -> 6/#4/2 -> Major 6 ↓1HS</p>
<p>This specific sonority falls in the Tied Bass, 3-#4-6, as well as another from the same family: the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/eighteenth-century-music/article/morte-a-galant-voiceleading-schema-as-emblem-of-lament-and-compositional-buildingblock/2CFE5B5CCA0E3F5FA06E07E6943606BD?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark" target="_blank">Morte</a>. In this case, the 63 chord on B or Bb is omitted, but it helps understand why this sonority is very similar to the 3-#4-6. It is the same sonority we would get in minor descending RO if we played v minor on *5 instead of V major. This sonority also belongs to the Wedge/Omnibus family because of the contrary motion of the bass & soprano.</p>

<p>Here's another similar sound, this time the dominant 6#42 sound is triggered from ♮*7</p>
<p>At 9:54 there's yet another, starting from V -> V42/N -> N6</p>
<p>To easily get the V -> V/N sound, use contrary motion: lower the bass by 1 HS and raise the chord by 1HS. Note that V/N is the key's Augmented 6th chord, here in inversion.</p>
