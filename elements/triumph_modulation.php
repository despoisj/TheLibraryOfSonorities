<p>This modulation, which I call <i>'triumph modulation'</i> or <i>'triumphant wedge modulation'</i> moves from a major chord to the <b>Major scale a major third above</b> (ex. Cmaj -> Emaj, i.e. I -> III) by reinterpretating the I chord (or I7) as a German augmented 6th chord, and resolving it via I64 -> V7 -> I in the new key. Its very bright sound is often used as a triumphant gesture, hence the name.</p>
<p>Note that this modulation can also be obtained from a diminished 7th chord (functioning as a rootless V7b9 chord): C#°7 ~ C7b9 -> Emaj64 -> B7 -> Emaj. This also means a diminishe 7th chord can be used for a triumph modulation to 4 different keys.</p>
<p><b>Keyboard Tip:</b> An easy way to practice this modulation is to see it as a symmetric wedge motion from a major chord: the root is lowered by a half step, and the 5th is raised by a half step.</p>

<p>At 1:51, bar 7 and on: Gmaj -> Bmaj64 -> F#7 -> ...</p>
<p>i.e. I -> [I64 -> V7 -> ~I] of III</p>
<p>Note: here the resolution is aborted, we don't get the expected Bmaj, but the sound of the start of the modulation is pretty clear.</p>

<?php tt("Chopin - Nocturne Op. 27 n°1")?>
<p>At 2:38, the climax of the piece, we get a double triumph modulation: A#°7 -> Emaj64 -> B7 -> Emaj. The Emaj is directly used to start off another modulation, becoming at the same time a dominant 7th chord: E7 -> AbMaj64 -> Eb7 -> AbMaj.</p>

<p>At 13:04, we get it twice, last row after the Amaj arpeggio: A7 -> Db64 (aborted), then from the diminished 7th chord: G°7 -> Db64 -> Ab7 -> (elided).</p>

<p>Granted, this one doesn't sound as triumphant because of the delicate sound and texture, but the sound is there!</p>
